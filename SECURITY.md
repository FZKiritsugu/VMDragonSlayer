# Security Guidelines for VMDragonSlayer

## Overview

This document outlines security considerations and guidelines for VMDragonSlayer development and usage.

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Pickle Deserialization (HIGH RISK)
- **Issue**: The ML model loading uses pickle.load() which can execute arbitrary code
- **Mitigation**: Only load model files from trusted sources
- **Status**: Enhanced with size limits and warnings
- **Future**: Consider migrating to safer formats like ONNX or custom JSON serialization

### 2. Hash Algorithm Usage
- **Issue**: MD5 and SHA1 are cryptographically broken
- **Mitigation**: Added warnings when using weak algorithms
- **Recommendation**: Use SHA256 or SHA512 for new implementations

### 3. Dynamic Attribute Access
- **Issue**: getattr() usage can potentially access dangerous attributes
- **Mitigation**: Added validation helper functions
- **Recommendation**: Use allowlists for acceptable attribute names

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
3. **Code Review**: Ensure all changes undergo security review
4. **Testing**: Include security test cases in the test suite

### For Users
1. **Trusted Sources**: Only process files and models from trusted sources
2. **Sandboxing**: Run analysis in isolated environments when possible
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the framework updated to latest secure version
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor system resources when processing untrusted files

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [REDACTED - Add appropriate contact]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

## Security Audit History

- **2025-08-26**: Comprehensive security audit completed
  - Identified and fixed pickle deserialization risks
  - Enhanced hash algorithm usage with warnings
  - Added input validation helpers
  - Created security documentation

## Security Dependencies

The following dependencies are used for security-related functionality:

- `cryptography`: For secure cryptographic operations
- `hashlib`: For hashing (prefer SHA256+ algorithms)
- `secrets`: For secure random number generation (when needed)

## Future Security Improvements

1. Replace pickle serialization with safer alternatives
2. Implement comprehensive input validation framework
3. Add security-focused unit tests
4. Consider security-focused static analysis integration
5. Regular third-party security audits

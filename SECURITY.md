# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

VMDragonSlayer is currently in pre-release. Security updates will be provided for:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Security Model & Threat Assessment

### Threat Model

VMDragonSlayer operates in a high-risk environment, analyzing potentially malicious binaries and VM-protected executables. The following threat vectors are considered:

#### HIGH RISK
- **Malicious Model Files**: Pickle files can contain arbitrary code
- **Untrusted Binary Analysis**: Input binaries may contain exploits
- **Plugin Security**: IDA/Ghidra/Binary Ninja plugin attack surface

#### MEDIUM RISK  
- **API Endpoints**: Network exposure if running API server
- **File System Access**: Analysis may require filesystem operations
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Large binaries or complex VMs may consume excessive resources

#### LOW RISK
- **Configuration Files**: Generally trusted, use environment variables
- **Pattern Database**: JSON-based, limited attack surface

### Security Controls

#### Model Loading Security
**CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED**: Current model loading uses unsafe `pickle.load()` which allows arbitrary code execution.

**Current Implementation (UNSAFE):**
```python
# dragonslayer/ml/model.py:348 - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)  # ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION RISK
```

**Required Mitigations:**
1. **Use joblib with safety checks** (recommended)
2. **Implement restricted pickle loading** 
3. **Model file integrity verification** (checksums)
4. **Sandboxed model loading environment**

#### Binary Analysis Safety
- Run analysis in isolated environments (containers/VMs)
- Implement resource limits (memory, CPU, disk)
- Use read-only filesystem mounts where possible
- Monitor for suspicious activity during analysis

#### Plugin Security
- Validate all plugin inputs
- Use plugin sandboxing features where available
- Document minimum required permissions
- Regular security updates for plugin dependencies

## Known Security Issues

### CVE-PENDING-001: Unsafe Model Loading
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Identified, fix in progress  
**Description**: Pickle loading allows arbitrary code execution  
**Affected**: All versions prior to 2.1.0  
**Mitigation**: Do not load untrusted model files  

## Secure Usage Guidelines

### For Researchers & Analysts

1. **Isolation**: Always run VMDragonSlayer in isolated environments
2. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate analysis networks from production
3. **Model Verification**: Only use models from trusted sources
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all binary inputs before analysis
5. **Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging for audit trails

### For Plugin Users

1. **Update Regularly**: Keep IDA/Ghidra/Binary Ninja updated
2. **Permission Review**: Review plugin permission requests
3. **Backup Data**: Backup important analysis data before plugin use
4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network activity during analysis

### For API Deployments

1. **Authentication**: Implement strong API authentication
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with rate limiting
3. **Input Sanitization**: Validate all API inputs
4. **TLS**: Use TLS 1.3 for all API communications
5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive API monitoring

## Security Dependencies

### Required Security Updates

Regularly update these critical dependencies:
- **PyTorch**: For model loading security
- **scikit-learn**: For ML pipeline security  
- **FastAPI**: For API security (if using web interface)
- **cryptography**: For cryptographic operations

### Vulnerability Scanning

Run these tools regularly:
```bash
# Python dependency scanning
pip-audit

# Static security analysis  
bandit -r dragonslayer/

# General vulnerability scanning

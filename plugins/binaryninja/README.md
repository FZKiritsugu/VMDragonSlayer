def analyze_function(bv, function):
    vmd = VMDragonSlayer()
    results = vmd.analyze_mlil(function.mlil)
    
    for handler in results.handlers:
        function.set_comment(handler.address, f"VM Handler: {handler.type}")
        bv.set_comment_at(handler.address, f"Confidence: {handler.confidence}")
```
